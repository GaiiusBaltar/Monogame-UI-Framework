## Installation
You can simply include the UIFramework.dll as a reference to any Monogame project and it should just work. Don't forget to include the UIFramework namespace into any file using the framework.

## Information
This was coded a long time ago so I can't guarantee that it still works flawlessly. Plus, there are a lot of questionable design choices and difficult to understand code segments, so it might take some getting used to.
